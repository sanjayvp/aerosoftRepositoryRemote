Write Effective test cases following standards
It all depends upon how you write a test case.
Ultimately you test an application by keeping test case doc as a reference.
Which standards I need to follow while writing a test case ????
There is no standard..It is upto them how they define ...everyone they have their own way of writing their test case.
There is no prototype also to follow it !!
